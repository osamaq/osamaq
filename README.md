### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Osama and I do mobile app development at [Innov8tif](http://innov8tif.com/). We equip products with electronic-[KYC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer) solutions: digital identity verification through document and biometric checks.

I briefly worked with embedded systems and image processing as an intern and a research assistant before learning React in 2017 and falling in love with the web. Now, I build Android and iOS apps using React Native.
